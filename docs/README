=Overview=
The main purpose of Branchlocker is to restrict commit access to a list of
users and/or PRs.

Branchlocker Rewrite is an attempt to add functionality to the Branchlocker
tool, while reducing complexity, and supplying an API.

=Directory Structure=
The directory structure is broken up into the following areas:
* docs
* sql 
* src

==docs==
Holds all human readable written documentation that is not in line comments.

==sql==
Holds all files used in creating the PostgreSQL database and test data.

==src==
Holds the API, Command Line Interface (CLI) sources, and tests for both the
API and CLI.

=Server Setup=
The Branch Locker server was initialy developed and tested on a VM running
CentOS 6.4.

==Installing Required Software==
As root:
    * Update yum: $ yum update -y
    * Install Development Tools:
      $ yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"

    * Install Postgres 8.4:
      $ yum install -y postgresql postgresql-devel postgresql-server

    * Setup Postgres:
      $ service postgresql initdb

    * Create postgres user
      $ useradd postgres -M -d /var/lib/pgsql -g postgres
      $ chown -R postgres /var/lib/pgsql

    * Start postgresql service
      $ service postgresql start

    * Checkout Server Code
      $ mkdir /path/to/code
      $ cd /path/to/code
      $ git clone https://github.com/sumason2/branch-locker.git

    * Install CPAN
      $ yum install -y perl-CPAN

    * Tell CPAN to install all dependencies.
      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'my $c = "CPAN::HandleConfig"; $c->load(doit => 1, autoconfig => 1); $c->edit(prerequisites_policy => "follow"); $c->edit(build_requires_install_policy => "yes"); $c->commit'

    * Update CPAN
      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install CPAN'

    * Install Catalyst - These can take hours.
      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Catalyst'
      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Catalyst::Devel'

    * Compile and Test Code
      $ cd /path/to/code/web/BranchLocker
      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make
      $ make test

    * To Run Development server on port 3000
      $ /path/to/code/web/BranchLocker/script/branchlocker_server.pl

    * To Run Development server on another port
      $ /path/to/code/web/BranchLocker/script/branchlocker_server.pl -p 3030

    * Run Development server with test configuration
      $ BRANCHLOCKER_CONFIG_LOCAL_SUFFIX="test" \
      /path/to/code/web/BranchLocker/script/branchlocker_server.pl

    * Install EPEL yum repository - for mod_fcgid
      $ rpm -ivh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
      # Uncomment baseurl lines and comment mirrorlist lines in epel.repo

    * Deploy with Apache and Fast CGI
      $ yum install -y httpd httpd-devel mod_fcgid mod_ssl

    * Install Apache configurations.
      $ cp /path/to/code/web/apache-conf/*.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/.
